    <h2>Briefly about armored entityes</h2>
    <p>
      A military armored entity is a lightweight wheeled armored fighting
      vehicle, historically employed for reconnaissance, internal security,
      armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the gradual decline of mounted cavalry, armored entityes were
      developed for carrying out duties used to be assigned to light
      cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the invention of the tank, the armored entity remained popular
      due to its faster speed, comparatively simplified maintenance and low
      production cost.
